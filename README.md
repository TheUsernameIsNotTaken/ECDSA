# ECDSA
An implementation of ECDSA. Using the [secp256k1](https://replit.com/@billbuchanan/basicecdsa) Python implementation of [Bill Buchanan](https://replit.com/@billbuchanan) and my Professor's Math slides.

The parts of the program:
 * [secp256k1](https://replit.com/@billbuchanan/basicecdsa) by [Bill Buchanan](https://replit.com/@billbuchanan)
 * Implemented signing and verification math in Python.
 * Added handler classes for easier use.
 * Added two-sided signature test to show how it works.
